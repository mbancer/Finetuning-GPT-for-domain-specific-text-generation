To reduce the dependency on labels, various active-learning strategies have been proposed, typically based on the confidence of the detector. However, these methods are biased towards best-performing classes and can lead to acquired datasets that are not good representatives of the data in the testing set. In this work, we propose a unified framework for active learning, that considers both the uncertainty and the robustness of the detector, ensuring that the network performs accurately in all classes. Furthermore, our method is able to pseudo-label the very confident predictions, suppressing a potential distribution drift while further boosting the performance of the model. Experiments show that our method comprehensively outperforms a wide range of active-learning methods on PASCAL VOC07+12 and MS-COCO, having up to a 7.7% relative improvement, or up to 82% reduction in labeling cost.',\n"," 'Analyzing the structure of proteins is a key part of understanding their functions and thus their role in biology at the molecular level. In addition, design new proteins in a methodical way is a major engineering challenge. In this work, we introduce a joint geometric-neural networks approach for comparing, deforming and generating 3D protein structures. Viewing protein structures as 3D open curves, we adopt the Square Root Velocity Function (SRVF) representation and leverage its suitable geometric properties along with Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for a joint registration and comparison. Our ResNets handle better large protein deformations while being more computationally efficient. On top of the mathematical framework, we further design a Geometric Variational Auto-Encoder (G-VAE), that once trained, maps original, previously unseen structures, into a low-dimensional (latent) hyper-sphere. Motivated by the spherical structure of the pre-shape space, we naturally adopt the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model our hidden variables. We test the effectiveness of our models by generating novel protein structures and predicting completions of corrupted protein structures. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate plausible structures, different from the structures in the training data.',\n"," \"In this work, we extend standard neural networks by building upon an assumption that neuronal activations correspond to the angle of a complex number lying on the unit circle, or 'phasor.' Each layer in such a network produces new activations by taking a weighted superposition of the previous layer's phases and calculating the new phase value. This generalized architecture allows models to reach high accuracy and carries the singular advantage that mathematically equivalent versions of the network can be executed with or without regard to a temporal variable. Importantly, the value of a phase angle in the temporal domain can be sparsely represented by a periodically repeating series of delta functions or 'spikes'. We demonstrate the atemporal training of a phasor network on standard deep learning tasks and show that these networks can then be executed in either the traditional atemporal domain or spiking temporal domain with no conversion step needed. This provides a novel basis for constructing deep networkswhich operate via temporal, spike-based calculations suitable for neuromorphic computing hardware.\",\n"," 'Approximate Bayesian inference for neural networks is considered a robust alternative to standard training, often providing good performance on out-of-distribution data. However, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with high-fidelity approximate inference via full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo achieve poor generalization under covariate shift, even underperforming classical estimation. We explain this surprising result, showing how a Bayesian model average can in fact be problematic under covariate shift, particularly in cases where linear dependencies in the input features cause a lack of posterior contraction. We additionally show why the same issue does not affect many approximate inference procedures, or classical maximum a-posteriori (MAP) training. Finally, we propose novel priors that improve the robustness of BNNs to many sources of covariate shift.',\n"," 'With the advancement of deep neural networks and computer vision-based Human Activity Recognition, employment of Point-Cloud Data technologies (LiDAR, mmWave) has seen a lot interests due to its privacy preserving nature. Given the high promise of accurate PCD technologies, we develop, PALMAR, a multiple-inhabitant activity recognition system by employing efficient signal processing and novel machine learning techniques to track individual person towards developing an adaptive multi-inhabitant tracking and HAR system. More specifically, we propose (i) a voxelized feature representation-based real-time PCD fine-tuning method, (ii) efficient clustering (DBSCAN and BIRCH), Adaptive Order Hidden Markov Model based multi-person tracking and crossover ambiguity reduction techniques and (iii) novel adaptive deep learning-based domain adaptation technique to improve the accuracy of HAR in presence of data scarcity and diversity (device, location and population diversity). We experimentally evaluate our framework and systems using (i) a real-time PCD collected by three devices (3D LiDAR and 79 GHz mmWave) from 6 participants, (ii) one publicly available 3D LiDAR activity data (28 participants) and (iii) an embedded hardware prototype system which provided promising HAR performances in multi-inhabitants (96%) scenario with a 63% improvement of multi-person tracking than state-of-art framework without losing significant system performances in the edge computing device.']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":81}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h-BjFD_JGVI-"},"source":["And finally, I write the data (200 abstracts) to a text file:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"W4d-0cWvIOkG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1624473578052,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":388,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Bancerek","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhqapG6F07xEYiz2KfMg1g_6pTCT3lqtcRRlP_SHA=s64","userId":"12146753128068453167"}}},"source":["Outfile = open('data_abstracts.txt','a+')\n","Outfile.truncate(0)\n","for a in sub_web_page:\n","  Outfile.write(a + ' ')\n","Outfile.close()"],"execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"scBtqP_GdKPm"},"source":["# 2.
